# Can Opener
This is a simple to use can opener.

Inside Can Opner.rar you will find a FreeCad model of the part, as well as the part drawings.

Simply print out the drawing, and cut it out of a 3mm thick piece of steel. The can opener can easily be made with a hacksaw and a few files. There are holes in the handle if one wants to rivet on pin on handle scales..
